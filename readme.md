# Premier League Fan Web Application
The Premier League Fan App (PLFA) is a web application that has been designed to provide footall fans with a platform that can be used to socialise with other football fans,
partake in a fantasy football competition and read relevant football data.

This project was created during the final year of my BSc Computing course to contribute towards my final year project. It is only a concept web application and does not exist online. In the future intend to come back to this project and produce an improved version once I have expanded my web development abilties.

## Installation guide
To run this application a local apache server can be used. This will require external software to be installed, when developing this software I used 'XAMPP'.
To run this software on XAMPP, move this folder into the 'htdocs' folder that XAMPP will create for you. The database file, which can be found in the 'database' folder,
must be imported into phpmyadmin. Once these steps have been completed copy and paste the following URL into a web browser: (assuming your apache server is running) 
```
http://localhost/project/pl_fan_app/
```
